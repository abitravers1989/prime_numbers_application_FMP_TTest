# What is this application?

A console application which given a number, N, outputs a table of N's Prime Numbers.

To use it just input a whole number at or above 1 and expect to see a grid of XXX number prime numbers which occur after it.

# What language is it in?

Javascript

# What was my MVP

A user gives a number to the console.
A javascript programme which has been test driven, has an algorithm which can generate a list of 20,000+ prime numbers which start with (N+1 x N+1).
A grid of these number is output to the console.
An example when N is 3:

|      |    2 |    3 |    5 |
|    2 |    4 |    6 |   10 |
|    3 |    6 |    9 |   15 |
|    5 |   10 |   15 |   25 |

The number N must be 1 or above. First MVP will not include an error message for when this isn't done.

Unit test coverage is high.

-	a test driven approach
- loosely coupled and highly cohesive design
- perfection is not when there is nothing left to add, but when there is nothing left to take away
